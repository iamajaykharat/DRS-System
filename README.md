### Decision Review System (DRS) Technology Using Python

Third Umpire Decision Review System (DRS) is a technology-based
system used in cricket to assist the match officials with their decision-making.
On-field umpires may choose to consult with the third umpire (known as an
Umpire Review), and players may request that the third umpire consider a
decision of the on-field umpires (known as a Player Review).
